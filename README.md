## iHewa weather app

The project is built on ionic the angular framework for mobile development. The app fetches weather data from [Wunderground API](http://api.wunderground.com/api/). You first need to create an account which is free, get the api key then use that in the application to get the weather information.



### How to get the project:

Clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/meshnesh/Internation_weather_app.git
$ cd into iHewa
```

install the packages:

```bash
$ npm install
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

to run the project:

```bash
$ ionic serve
$ ionic cordova run ios
```
when you want to run in a simulator:

```bash
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
